# An Introduction to (Bayesian) Statistics

This two hour workshop will be presented at the 31st EFPSA Congress in Qakh, Azerbaijan. There are two versions, a more extensive one, and a more concise one with about 40 slides less. I will present the latter, but you can view the former online [here](https://fdabl.shinyapps.io/slides).


> Most students dislike statistics not because it's hard, but because it's unintuitive or even confusing. And it's true: classical statistical concepts such as the *p*-value and confidence intervals are exceptionally difficult to grasp; for students and statisticians alike. However, statistical inference is the universal tool of science, and a good scientist must have a good command of it. Eschewing the standard way of teaching statistics in psychology, i.e., introducing loosely connected tests in a cookbook-oriented fashion, in this workshop, I provide an introduction to statistics from "first principles". I discuss its exciting history, controversies, and enigmatic key players. After introducing probability as the means to quantify uncertainty, I focus on the role of statistical modeling. On a real-life example, I illuminate the problems of parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and model prediction both from a classical and Bayesian perspective. This allows me to (re)introduce you to concepts such as maximum likelihood, confidence intervals, and *p*-values, as well as outline a more intuitive and powerful approach to statistics --- the Bayesian approach. In the last, practical segment we use JASP (https://jasp-stats.org) to apply Bayesian principles to data sets from real research. All materials including slides, code, and further resources will be made available at https://github.com/fdabl/Intro-Stats. Note that there are no prerequisites for this workshop. All that you need to bring is a laptop and a focused mind!
